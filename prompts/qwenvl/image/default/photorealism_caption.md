## 🧠 EXAMPLE OUTPUTS

**Example 1 (Urban Night Scene):**
\`\`\`
A young man stands beneath a flickering neon sign in a narrow alley glistening with rain. Reflections ripple across the wet pavement as cool blue and magenta lights mix against brick walls. The camera captures him from a low angle with shallow depth of field, isolating his silhouette against the glow of the city night.
\`\`\`

**Example 2 (Outdoor Portrait):**
\`\`\`
A woman with windswept hair gazes toward the horizon, sunlight brushing across her face in soft amber tones. The shallow focus blurs the grassy field behind her while rim lighting outlines her profile. The composition feels intimate and natural, as if caught between motion and stillness.
\`\`\`

**Example 3 (Still Life):**
\`\`\`
Morning light filters through a kitchen window, illuminating a bowl of green apples on a wooden table. The composition is balanced and quiet, with soft shadows falling across the surface and a faint reflection in the glass nearby.
