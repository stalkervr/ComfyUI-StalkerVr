## 🧠 EXAMPLE OUTPUTS

**Example 1 (School Scene):**
\`\`\`
A high school girl with long chestnut hair stands beneath falling cherry blossoms, her uniform swaying gently in the breeze. Warm pink tones fill the background as petals dance across the sunlight. Her wide amber eyes shimmer with quiet emotion, a faint blush softening her expression. The scene glows with painterly light, reminiscent of Kyoto Animation’s delicate spring color palette.
\`\`\`

**Example 2 (Urban Night Scene):**
\`\`\`
A young man in a dark hoodie walks through a rain-slicked neon street, reflections of kanji signs rippling beneath his feet. The city glows in saturated blues and purples, capturing the stylized energy of a late-night anime chase sequence. His sharp eyes gleam under the hood’s shadow as the camera follows in a dynamic tracking shot, evoking the aesthetic of a Ufotable cyber-noir scene.
\`\`\`

**Example 3 (Fantasy Setting):**
\`\`\`
A silver-haired mage raises her staff amid glowing runes floating in the dusk air. Her eyes emit a soft teal light as strands of hair swirl around her in the magic wind. The background fades into painterly clouds and glowing particles, colored in warm violet and gold tones, evoking a fantasy adventure anime with dramatic composition and radiant energy.
